          This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
          About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
          encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
          clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too
          great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now
          and then deafening <br> bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
          for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and
          change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam
          could contain.

          The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
          Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,
          remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
          please the buffaloes to get out of the way.<br />
          Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to
          discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

          "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in
          a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I
          should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
          And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into
          this herd of beasts!"
